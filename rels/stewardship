stewardship
==========

The *stewardship* rel relates a profile (user) to a resource representing the organizations of
which they are a content steward.  Note that in order for a user to be a content steward, they
must have an appropriate role granted by the security plugin.  The presence of an organization
in the stewardship list for a user merely indicates that the user **would** be a steward of that
organization if the user has the appropriate role, not that the user necessarily **is** a
steward of that organization.
